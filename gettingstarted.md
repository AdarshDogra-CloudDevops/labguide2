## üîé Lab Overview
In this lab, you will build a **highly available web application setup** using an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** and an **Auto Scaling Group (ASG)**.

The lab consists of 4 modules:

1. **Creating a Launch Template** ‚Äì Provision EC2 instances with a preconfigured Apache web server.  
2. **Configuring a Load Balancer** ‚Äì Deploy an Application Load Balancer (ALB) with a Target Group for traffic distribution.  
3. **Setting up an Auto Scaling Group (ASG)** ‚Äì Automate scaling of EC2 instances to ensure availability and resilience.  
4. **Validation** ‚Äì Test the load balancer DNS and validate ASG behavior by terminating instances.

By the end of this lab, you will understand how to deploy scalable and highly available applications on AWS using ALB + ASG.
